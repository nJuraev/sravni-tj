# Scaffolding Commands

Commands to generate the standard Playwright project structure from scratch.

---

## Bash / macOS / Linux / WSL

### Base structure (Level 1 — flat)

```bash
mkdir -p tests pages components fixtures utils mocks test-data/auth test-data/images .github/workflows

# Placeholder files to preserve folders in git
touch pages/.gitkeep
touch components/.gitkeep
touch utils/.gitkeep
touch mocks/.gitkeep
touch test-data/images/.gitkeep

# Gitignore auth state files
echo "test-data/auth/\*.auth.json" >> .gitignore
echo "playwright-report/" >> .gitignore
echo "test-results/" >> .gitignore
echo "blob-report/" >> .gitignore

# Fixtures barrel file
cat > fixtures/index.ts << 'EOF'
import { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/test';

// Extend with your custom fixtures here
// import { authFixtures } from './auth.fixture';
// export const test = base.extend(authFixtures);

export const test = base;
export { expect };
EOF

echo "Base structure created."
```

---

### Feature-grouped structure (Level 2)

```bash
# Tests grouped by feature
mkdir -p tests/auth tests/dashboard tests/settings

# Pages grouped by feature
mkdir -p pages/auth pages/dashboard pages/settings

# Shared components
mkdir -p components

# Fixtures, utils, test-data, mocks
mkdir -p fixtures utils mocks test-data/auth test-data/images

# CI
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Gitignore
cat >> .gitignore << 'EOF'
playwright-report/
test-results/
blob-report/
test-data/auth/*.auth.json
EOF

echo "Feature-grouped structure created."
```

---

### Full domain-based structure (Level 3)

```bash
# Test directories by type and feature
mkdir -p \
  tests/e2e \
  tests/features/auth \
  tests/features/catalog \
  tests/features/cart \
  tests/features/checkout \
  tests/api \
  tests/visual

# Page Objects by feature
mkdir -p \
  pages/auth \
  pages/catalog \
  pages/cart \
  pages/checkout

# Components, fixtures, mocks
mkdir -p components
mkdir -p fixtures
mkdir -p utils/api utils/builders
mkdir -p mocks

# Test data by feature
mkdir -p \
  test-data/auth \
  test-data/catalog \
  test-data/checkout \
  test-data/images

# CI
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Gitignore
cat >> .gitignore << 'EOF'
playwright-report/
test-results/
blob-report/
test-data/auth/*.auth.json
EOF

echo "Domain-based structure created."
```

---

## PowerShell (Windows)

### Base structure (Level 1 — flat)

```powershell
# Create folders
$folders = @(
  "tests", "pages", "components", "fixtures",
  "utils", "test-data\auth", "test-data\images", ".github\workflows"
)
foreach ($f in $folders) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $f }

# Gitignore entries
Add-Content .gitignore "`nplaywright-report/"
Add-Content .gitignore "test-results/"
Add-Content .gitignore "blob-report/"
Add-Content .gitignore "test-data/auth/*.auth.json"

# Fixtures barrel
Set-Content fixtures\index.ts @"
import { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/test';

// Extend with your custom fixtures here
// import { authFixtures } from './auth.fixture';
// export const test = base.extend(authFixtures);

export const test = base;
export { expect };
"@

Write-Host "Base structure created."
```

---

### Feature-grouped structure (Level 2 — PowerShell)

```powershell
$folders = @(
  "tests\auth", "tests\dashboard", "tests\settings",
  "pages\auth", "pages\dashboard", "pages\settings",
  "components", "fixtures", "utils", "mocks",
  "test-data\auth", "test-data\images",
  ".github\workflows"
)
foreach ($f in $folders) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $f }

Add-Content .gitignore "`nplaywright-report/"
Add-Content .gitignore "test-results/"
Add-Content .gitignore "test-data/auth/*.auth.json"

Write-Host "Feature-grouped structure created."
```

---

## npm Script (cross-platform, add to package.json)

Add this script to `package.json` for a one-command setup:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "scaffold": "node scripts/scaffold.mjs"
  }
}
```

The full implementation lives at [`scripts/scaffold.mjs`](../scripts/scaffold.mjs) — copy that file into your project's `scripts/` folder.

Run with:

```bash
npm run scaffold
```

---

## After Scaffolding — Next Steps

```bash
# 1. Install Playwright (if not done)
npm init playwright@latest

# 2. Install browsers
npx playwright install

# 3. Verify config
npx playwright test --list

# 4. Run first test
npx playwright test

# 5. Open report
npx playwright show-report
```
